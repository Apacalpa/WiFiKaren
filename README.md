# WiFiKaren
KarenWiFi is a passive-aggressive Wi-Fi system that monitors network activity and yells sarcastic insults at users. Built with OpenWRT, a Raspberry Pi, and a speaker amp, it uses OpenAI + Google TTS (or custom sounds) to turn your router into a judgmental nightmare. Configurable via a local web UI.
